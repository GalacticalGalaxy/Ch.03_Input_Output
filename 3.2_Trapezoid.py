TRAPEZOID PROGRAM
-------------------
Create a new program that will ask the user for the information needed to find the area of a trapezoid, and then print the area.

Test with the following:

base 1: 2       base 2: 3    height: 4    area: 10
base 1: 5       base 2: 7    height: 2    area: 12
base 1: 1       base 2: 2    height: 3    area: 4.5
base 1: 7       base 2: 2    height: 4    area: 18
'''

base1 = int(input("What do you want base 1 to be? "))
base2 = int(input("What do you want base 2 to be? "))
height = int(input("What do you want the height to be? "))
print("Area =", (base1 + base2)/2 * height)
